Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group. Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration.[2] In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.[3]
